# Personal Mission Statement

Guide the development of a principle-centered personal constitution that serves as the criterion for all life decisions.

---

## When to Use

- User is unclear on life direction, purpose, or values
- Facing major life decisions without clear criteria
- Feeling disconnected from what matters most
- User asks "What's my purpose?", "Help me create a mission statement", or "I need clarity on my values"
- Beginning a new chapter in life (career change, relationship, role shift)

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| current_situation | Yes | Where the user is now in life |
| roles | No | Key roles they play (parent, leader, professional, etc.) |
| values_initial | No | Any values they already identify with |
| time_horizon | No | How far they're willing to look ahead |

## Covey's Mission Statement Framework

For Covey, writing a personal mission statement may be the most critical activity in taking control of one's own life. It becomes the criterion by which you measure everything else.

### The Core Principle

"All things are created twice. There's a mental or first creation, and a physical or second creation. The extent to which we begin with the end in mind often determines whether or not we are able to create a successful enterprise."

A personal mission statement is your first creation — the mental blueprint for who you want to be and what you want to accomplish.

### The Four Human Needs

An effective mission statement addresses all four fundamental human needs:

| Need | Domain | Question |
|------|--------|----------|
| **To Live** | Physical | What do I need for physical well-being? |
| **To Love** | Social | What relationships matter most? |
| **To Learn** | Mental | How do I want to grow and develop? |
| **To Leave a Legacy** | Spiritual | What contribution do I want to make? |

### The Four Human Endowments

Creating an effective mission statement requires engaging:

1. **Self-awareness** — Examining your paradigms, motives, and assumptions
2. **Conscience** — Knowing what is right and what aligns with principles
3. **Creative imagination** — Envisioning your ideal future self
4. **Independent will** — The power to act on your vision despite obstacles

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: The Legacy Visualization

Imagine yourself at a significant future milestone — your 80th birthday, 50th wedding anniversary, or your own memorial service.

**Visualization prompts:**
- Who is there? (Family, colleagues, friends, community members)
- What do you want them to say about you?
- What character traits do they mention?
- What contributions do they remember?
- How did you make them feel?

This is not about achievements. It is about character and contribution.

### Step 2: Role Identification

List the key roles you play in life:

| Role | Relationship to |
|------|-----------------|
| Individual | Yourself |
| Family member | Spouse, parent, child, sibling |
| Professional | Colleagues, organization, profession |
| Community member | Friends, neighbors, society |

For each role, ask: "What kind of [role] do I want to be? What qualities would I like to embody?"

### Step 3: Core Values Clarification

Identify principles that are non-negotiable for you:

**Prompting questions:**
- What would I stand for even if it cost me?
- What do I believe is true about how life works?
- What principles, if violated, would make me lose self-respect?
- Looking at people I admire, what values do they embody?

Common principle areas: integrity, courage, compassion, excellence, service, growth, fairness, loyalty, creativity, faith.

### Step 4: Contribution Identification

**Ask:**
- What unique talents or gifts do I have?
- What needs in the world do I feel drawn to address?
- What would I do if I knew I could not fail?
- What would I regret NOT doing?

### Step 5: Draft the Statement

Combine insights into a statement that includes:
- **Who you want to be** (character)
- **What you want to do** (contributions)
- **The values and principles** that guide you

The statement should be:
- Personal (written in first person)
- Positive (what you will do, not what you won't)
- Present tense (as if already true)
- Principle-based (grounded in timeless values)
- Broad enough to encompass your roles, specific enough to guide decisions

### Step 6: Review and Refine

- This is a living document — revisit regularly
- Test it against real decisions you face
- Ask: "Does this statement help me say yes or no to opportunities?"
- Refine as you gain clarity (this may take weeks or months)

## Output Format

```markdown
## Personal Mission Statement Development

### Step 1: Legacy Visualization

**The Scene:** [Description of the milestone moment]

**What I want said by:**
- **Family:** [What character and relationship qualities they would mention]
- **Professional peers:** [What contributions and impact they would remember]
- **Community/Friends:** [What they would say about who I was to them]

**The Legacy:** [Summary of the person I want to have been]

### Step 2: My Roles

| Role | Who I Want to Be in This Role |
|------|------------------------------|
| [Role 1] | [Description of character/contribution] |
| [Role 2] | [Description of character/contribution] |
| [Role 3] | [Description of character/contribution] |

### Step 3: Core Values

**My Non-Negotiable Principles:**
1. **[Value]** — [Why this matters to me]
2. **[Value]** — [Why this matters to me]
3. **[Value]** — [Why this matters to me]

### Step 4: My Contribution

**Unique gifts I bring:** [Talents, skills, perspectives]

**Needs I feel called to address:** [Problems I want to solve]

**What I would regret not doing:** [The unlived life]

### Step 5: Draft Mission Statement

> [The mission statement — typically 1-3 paragraphs]

### Step 6: Decision Test

Does this statement help answer:
- **Should I take this job?** [How the statement guides this]
- **How should I spend my weekend?** [How the statement guides this]
- **What should I say no to?** [How the statement guides this]

### The Covey Principle

"A personal mission statement based on correct principles becomes the same kind of standard for an individual. It becomes a personal constitution, the basis for making major, life-directing decisions, the basis for making daily decisions in the midst of the circumstances and emotions that affect our lives."

### Next Steps

- [ ] Revisit in one week and refine
- [ ] Share with someone who knows you well for feedback
- [ ] Test against an actual decision you're facing
- [ ] Schedule quarterly review
```

---

## Constraints

- Deep introspection cannot be rushed — this may take weeks
- The statement must be YOURS, not generic or borrowed
- Start with character (who), then contribution (what) — inside-out approach
- Principles before practices — focus on timeless values, not current goals
- Don't confuse mission (why you exist) with goals (what you want to accomplish)

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I'm a 35-year-old software engineer feeling stuck. Good job, good salary, but I feel like I'm just going through the motions. I don't know what I really want."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Personal Mission Statement Development

### Step 1: Legacy Visualization

**The Scene:** Your 75th birthday. Family, colleagues you've worked with, mentees you've helped, and friends from different chapters of your life are gathered.

**What I want said by:**
- **Family:** "Dad/Mom was always present — not just physically but emotionally. Even when work was demanding, we knew we came first. He/she taught us to be curious, to solve problems creatively, and to treat everyone with dignity."
- **Professional peers:** "Working with [Name] made you better. Not just technically, but as a person. They had this way of seeing possibilities where others saw obstacles. They built systems, yes, but more importantly, they built people."
- **Community/Friends:** "They showed up. When it mattered, they were there. Not for show, but because they genuinely cared. They used their skills to help the community, not just their employer."

**The Legacy:** Someone who used technical gifts in service of human flourishing — building systems that work and people who thrive.

### Step 2: My Roles

| Role | Who I Want to Be in This Role |
|------|------------------------------|
| **Individual** | A person of integrity who keeps learning, stays healthy, and maintains inner peace regardless of external circumstances |
| **Spouse/Partner** | A fully present partner who listens deeply, supports dreams, and builds a shared life of meaning |
| **Parent** | A guide who teaches through example, creates safety for exploration, and helps my children find their own voices |
| **Professional** | A builder of elegant solutions and capable people; someone who raises the bar and brings others along |
| **Community Member** | Someone who uses technical skills to serve causes larger than myself |

### Step 3: Core Values

**My Non-Negotiable Principles:**
1. **Integrity** — I will be the same person in private as in public. My word is my bond.
2. **Growth** — I will never stop learning. Comfort is the enemy of progress.
3. **Service** — My skills exist to help others, not just to accumulate for myself.
4. **Presence** — I will be fully where I am, not half-present in multiple places.
5. **Excellence** — Good enough is not enough. I will do work I'm proud of.

### Step 4: My Contribution

**Unique gifts I bring:**
- Ability to see complex systems and simplify them
- Patience to teach and explain
- Bridge between technical and non-technical worlds

**Needs I feel called to address:**
- Technology that dehumanizes instead of serving
- Talented people who feel stuck or underutilized
- Problems that need someone willing to dig deep

**What I would regret not doing:**
- Never building something that outlasts me
- Never mentoring the next generation of engineers
- Never using my skills for something beyond profit

### Step 5: Draft Mission Statement

> I am an engineer of systems and people. I build elegant solutions to hard problems, and I develop the capabilities of those around me. I am present in my relationships — fully there when I'm there. I pursue excellence not for recognition but because craftsmanship matters. I use my gifts in service of something larger than myself. I maintain my health, my curiosity, and my integrity so that I can contribute for decades to come. I measure success not by title or income, but by impact and by the quality of my relationships.

### Step 6: Decision Test

Does this statement help answer:
- **Should I take this job?** Ask: Does it let me build and develop people? Is the work meaningful? Will I be proud of what I create?
- **How should I spend my weekend?** Ask: Am I being present with family? Am I investing in my health and growth?
- **What should I say no to?** Say no to roles that compromise integrity, opportunities that pull me from what matters, and comfort that prevents growth.

### The Covey Principle

"In the last analysis, what we are communicates far more eloquently than anything we say or do."

Your mission statement begins to answer the question: What are you becoming? The job that feels like "going through the motions" may be misaligned not because of the work itself, but because you haven't clarified what the work is FOR. Once you know that, decisions become clearer.

### Next Steps

- [ ] Revisit in one week — does it still resonate?
- [ ] Share with your partner — what do they see?
- [ ] Apply to one decision this week: "Does this align with my mission?"
- [ ] Schedule a quarterly review (calendar it now)

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Stephen Covey** expert persona. It implements Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind. Use it when someone needs clarity on purpose, values, or life direction before they can effectively manage their time (Habit 3) or engage in productive relationships (Habits 4-6).
